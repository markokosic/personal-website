# Devlog 003 – Mantine migration done, back to backend work

## Status

- Migrated all existing components to `Mantine`
- Started implementing CRUD for `customers` on the backend

## Problems / Errors

- API client (Bruno) did not send cookies correctly, resulting in `403 Forbidden` responses. Switched to Insomnia after some investigation.

## Learnings

- No major new learnings today; mostly revisited existing Spring Beans and backend code.

## Next steps

- Finish CRUD for `customers`
- Start implementing the UI for `customers` CRUD
