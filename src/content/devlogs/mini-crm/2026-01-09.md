# Devlog 004 – `createCustomers`

## Status

- Continued CRUD for `customers` (limited progress today due to time constraints).

## Problems / Errors

- Server responded with `400 - Failed to read HTTP message`.
- Although `Controller`, `Service`, and `Repository` appeared correct, the issue was using `@NotBlank` on a `Long` field. Switched to `@NotNull`, and it works perfectly now.

## Learnings

- `@NotBlank` is only for `Strings`; use `@NotNull` for numeric types like `Long`.

## Next steps

- Complete CRUD operations for `customers`.
