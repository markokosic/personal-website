# Devlog 005 – Tables, DDD and DTO's

## Status

- Another short session today, about 90 minutes.
- Wrote roughly 10 lines of code for the `createCustomer` function, including mapping from the frontend DTO to the domain DTOs.

## Problems / Errors

- Spent a lot of time discussing and reflecting on database design decisions.
- Realization: the `customers` table acts as a `read-side / search index`, while `companies` and `persons` form the `write-side / domain`, where the business truth resides.
- Consideration: To make searching performant, additional fields in the `customers` table will be needed.

## Learnings

- Encountered new concepts like `CQRS`, `Domain-Driven Design`, `Aggregation`, and `God-Table`.

## Next steps

- Complete CRUD operations for `customers`.
