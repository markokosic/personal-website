# Devlog 006 – Customer cleanup

## Status

- I spent my last few days with learning about architecture and design. I bought the books Clean Architecture and Designing Data-Intensive Applications.
- Implemented some new learnings and cleaned up the codebase.
- Removed unnecessary tables and models

## Problems / Errors

- Understanding complex takes time, the problem was me putting pressure on my self to understand it faster.

## Learnings

- Polymorphism
- SOLID Architecture
- Factory Pattern
- DiscriminatorValue

## Next steps

- Complete CRUD operations for `customers`.
