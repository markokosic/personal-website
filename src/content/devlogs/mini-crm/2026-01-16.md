# Devlog 007 – Customer Create Read, first factory function

## Status

- Finished `CREATE` and `READ` for customers.
- Implemented a factory function for creating customers and created
- Refactored DTO for customer `requests` and `responses`

## Problems / Errors

- Everything went smooth today

## Learnings

- `@AfterMapping` for Mappers
- Remove NULL from responses with `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)`

## Next steps

- Complete basic `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations for `customers`
- Test everything thoroughly
- Try to understand where to validate requests and where to throw error messages
