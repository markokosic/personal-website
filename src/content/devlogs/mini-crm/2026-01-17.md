# Devlog 008 – Update customer

## Status

- Working on `UPDATE` customer.
- Switched folder structure from layered to feature based.

## Problems / Errors

Updating is working so far but only if i send all `ConsumerCustomer` or `BusinessCustomer` fields in the request body. The next points I have to figure out are:

- How do I distinguish if the frontend wants a change on a `consumer` or `business` customer without sending me the type.
- How do I check if the request is an instance of `consumer` or `business`.
- How to change the update DTO's so, that the frontend can send me only the fields that need to be changed.

## Learnings

- Layered vs feature based structure

## Next steps

- Find solutions on how to correctly update customers.
