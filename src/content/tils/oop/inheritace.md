Inheritance

Inheritance is an object-oriented programming principle where a class (child/subclass) derives from another class (parent/superclass).

When no superclass is defined, your class is implicitly extended of the class Object. Object is the root of all inheritance hierarchies and the only class in Java that doesn`t extend another class.
